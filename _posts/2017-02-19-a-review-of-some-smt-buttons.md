# A review of surface mount buttons

I haven't posted in a long time and I am now finally making updates.
I'm going to start with something super exciting (not really).
This is a brief review of some surface mount buttons.  Tactile push buttons, to be specific.

When picking out a button I'm tempted to just purchase a bunch of different ones to see which one I like
since it's hard to get a feel for ergonomics from an online distributer like Digikey.  So this is to post
pictures of what I ordered and to make some comments for other people looking for the perfect SMT button.

# The buttons

### Vanilla option

The most basic button I think most SMT projects get.  Relatively big, easy to push.  Stick out color.

### Low profile, good area

I like this type since it's pretty easy to push, a lower height, and a nicer color profile.  Soldering it by hand might be a little
more difficult.

### Small area, still good tactile feedback

This is an even smaller button and still has good tactile feedback.  Since it has smaller surface area to press,
I think it's not quite as easy to give input via finger as the other options.

of the button in the image is not necessarily the real color of the button.

# Really small, bad feedback

These are the smallest buttons I got.  They definitely don't provide good tactile feedback and are relatively difficult
to press using just a finger.  These would be good for when you don't want the button to be pressed by accident -- a person
would have to grab a pen or something and very deliberately press it.

# Metal domes

These are quite different from all the rest.  Metal domes, as offered by [snaptron](http://www.snaptron.com/), come in a lot of
different shapes and sizes.  One thing that I like is that they are all rated by the amount of force required to "press" the dome in.
I got a nice sample to test out using these domes as small, 1 bit pressure sensors.  They can't be soldered, but there are a couple other
methods to attach them to a PCB, all pick and place compatible.


# What am I missing?

Currently this is a small list.  Send me a message if you think I missed something.  I appreciate mail and I will update my post if I get anything.
