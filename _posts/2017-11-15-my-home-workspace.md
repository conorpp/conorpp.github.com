Everyone's workspace is different.  Mine is a culmination of things that I've seen from other people's workspaces
and tools that I've found useful.


#### Here is my main desk.

It's a bit messy but that's okay.  I use it as a workbench often, and you should never trust a clean workbench.

Some things that I think are important:
 * Good monitor space.
 * Nice keyboard, mouse, and chair
 * Plenty of shelves

I also use a 3D printer regularly for prototyping.

It's great to have something like this right by my desk and makes quick work of mechanical problems I run into.
I used to have a homebrew delta printer that I used to use but I got tired of the maintenance and wanted something capable of
dual extrusion for supports.  I got an Ultimaker and it's been great so far.

Having a whiteboard helps me organize my thoughts from time to time and keep track of things I have finished.

#### This is my garage.

I live in a townhome with two others and I'm fortunate they were okay with turning the garage into a mini-workshop.

The heart of most of my work happens here, at the work bench.

I highlighted a number of important parts.

1. [Arm-mounted](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Premium-Single-Monitor-Stand/dp/B00MIBN16O) monitor.
It's nice to plug a laptop in and do some "live" firmware development or just pull up some datasheets.
I can always swing it out of the way.
2. Top shelve space.
3. [Wall mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BT4G8Y) and [plastic bins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BT4G8E).  Basically more shelving space.  Can also 3D print custom bins/hooks easily but I haven't done that yet.
4. [Hot air reflow gun](https://www.amazon.com/Kohree-Digital-Rework-Station-Solder/dp/B00ITMPQS2) and soldering iron (I recommend Hakko brand).
5. Nice long power strip.
6. [Function generator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GQNNVH4), [oscilloscope](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RJPXB6Y), [digital programmable power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H7ANBS8).  It's also nice to have these on some
sort of hutch to save space.  My DMM is only single channel and it would be _really_ nice to have two channels.  I recommend going for a two-channel.
7. Peg board for hanging stuff.  I don't have very much, I'd recommend getting more space pegged out.
8. Bench vice.  I should get a slightly bigger one.
9. Lower shelving/storage space.

More shelves.  Can never have enough.  The [wire-based shelves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018YLFJX4) are pretty strong and easy to assemble and collapse.  [Akro-Mils storage bins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000189CSC)
are great for dumping projects in.  They are strong, stackable, fully closed, and easy to open/close.


And have I mentioned shelves on wheels yet?

Having some easily movable shelves is great for context switches between projects.  I got these for $10
from a [Virginia Tech surplus auction](https://www.procurement.vt.edu/surplusproperty/vtauction.html).


And lastly, I have a second home-made workbench.  (And let me tell you, it's much easier making the 2nd workbench...).

Here I put some larger tools and more shelving.  Drill press, chop saw, band saw, and an air compressor.  I was lucky to get the bandsaw and
compressor from a yard-sale and auction.  I've used the air compressor the most and have used the other tools moderately.

# My space

I've been optimizing my workspace for a while now and it's kind of converged on
this.  I just wanted to share what's worked for me.  There's certainly some amount of tools
not shown that I never used.  Maybe I'll make a "things I shouldn't have bought but this
is what I was thinking at the time" kind of post.
